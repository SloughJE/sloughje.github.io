                    <!-- 
                    <p>With years of experience in data science consulting, I've helped organizations transform complex data into actionable strategies. My expertise lies in not just analyzing data, but in crafting narratives that drive decision-making across various industries. From retail and manufacturing to healthcare and aerospace, I've navigated the unique challenges each sector presents and delivered tailored data-driven solutions.</p>
                
                    <p>My journey in data science has been a blend of continuous learning and practical application. After obtaining a Master's in Statistics and an MBA, I delved into the world of consulting where I've helped businesses leverage data for competitive advantage. Whether it's through developing forecasting models to streamline operations or creating intuitive dashboards for real-time decision support, I've seen firsthand the transformative impact of well-applied data science.</p>
                
                    <p>Among the highlights of my consulting tenure was collaborating with NASA to refine aircraft landing time predictions. This project not only enhanced air traffic management but also led to a <a href="https://aviationsystems.arc.nasa.gov/publications/2021/20210017594_Wesely_Aviation2021_paper.pdf" target="_blank">published article</a>, showcasing the project's success and the practical benefits of predictive analytics.</p>
                
                    <p>My practical experience is complemented by projects that are close to my heart, like developing a machine learning solution for <a href="https://github.com/SloughJE/aerial_straps_classifier"target="_blank">classifying aerial straps poses</a>. It's a project that covers the full spectrum of data science work - from conception, data collection and preprocessing to model development and deployment. It exemplifies my commitment to real-world applications of machine learning, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical solutions.</p>

                    <p>I offer services ranging from machine learning model development to setting up data visualizations and analysis pipelines. My approach is always to simplify without oversimplifying, ensuring that the insights are clear, concise, and, above all, actionable.</p>
                
                    <p>If your business is looking to harness the power of data science without getting lost in technicalities, I am here to guide you through the journey. Let's unveil the stories hidden within your data together.</p>
                    -->

                    <p>After obtaining a Master's in Statistics from University College Dublin, I begain working in data science consulting. 
                        My six-plus years of consulting introduced me to working in many different industries. </p> 
                    <p>My work ranged from constructing energy dashboards for a utility company to optimizing machine learning models to predict intra-flight aircraft landing times for NASA. 
                        I developed models predicting hotel occupancy rates for a hospitality company, and for a client consulting company I created an interactive dashboard that modeled their online meeting network traffic.</p>
                    <p>In addition to consulting, I worked directly for a cybersecurity company aiming to develop machine learning models to identify malware in network traffic.</p> 
                    <p>Through it all, the cornerstone of my practice became clear communication, ensuring stakeholders grasp the necessary details to understand the solution's impact on their business.</p>

                    <p>Seeing a niche for agile, project-based data science expertise, I decided to establish my own practice. I cater to those in need of a skilled data scientist who adapts quickly, communicates effectively, and values simplicity over complexity in solution design.</p>
                        
                    <p>My commitment for each project is to present outcomes as plainly and understandably as possible, whether it be a visual dashboard, a complex ML pipeline or a educational seminar.</p>

                    <p>I prioritize simplicity, clarity, and meaningful results for your business.</p>
